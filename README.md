# Data Scientist

Welcome! 

I'm an early-career data analyst/scientist with a background in Business Analytics and a current M.Sc. in Biostatistics & Data Science (Stockholm).

I recently interned at Statistics Netherlands (CBS), where I helped build an OCR pipeline and worked on noisy text classification, learning the trade-offs between accuracy, speed and maintainability. 

I'm proficient in Python, R, and SQL; can build dashboards in Power BI/Tableau and I'm actively learning more about NLP, time series and deep learning. I'm seeking a junior role or internship where I can contribute and learn from an experienced team.
