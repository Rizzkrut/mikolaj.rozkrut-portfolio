# Data Scientist

Welcome! I'm a Data Scientist with hands-on experience in model development, data pipeline optimization, and deep learning, currently working at **Toyota Financial Services**.

I am deepening my expertise in machine learning and biostatistics through my **Master's in Biostatistics and Data Science** at a joint program with Karolinska Institutet, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, and Stockholm University. My background also includes a **BSc in Business Analytics** and a **BSc in European Law**, giving me a unique perspective on both the technical and regulatory aspects of data.
